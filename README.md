# Restaurant Reviews App

* * *

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project a static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application as a part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. In **Stage One**, a static design was taken that lacked accessibility and the design was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was also added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Start the Application

1.  In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    -   In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 54031` (or some other port, if port 54031 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 54031`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    -   Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 54031`.

2.  With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:54031`.
